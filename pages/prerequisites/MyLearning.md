## Learn vs My Learning

Learn is our legacy mobile app. This app does not support our latest technology [Blendedx]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab6_IiCz1a8 ). This app is maintained, but will not evolve anymore.

We strongly recommend migrating to [My Learning]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcR7IznmaHE ). Get in touch with your CrossKnowledge contact to have more information.

## Compatibility

My Learning is compatible with the following devices:
* Apple iOS: any device with iOS 10 and above
* Android: any device with Android KitKat 4.4 (API 19) - a non contractual list can be found [here](http://www.theandroidcop.com/list-of-android-smartphones-and-tablets-getting-android-4-4-kitkat-update)
* Windows Phone: we do not have a native app, and we did not plan it, but our CKLS can be accessed via the browser.
It is available on both stores under CrossKnowledge My Learning

## Offline content

My Learning allows downloading Blendedx learning resources offline, to view them with no connectivity.

To download offline learning resources, the usersâ€™ devices must have enough space on their local storage to host those files. In addition, to avoid overhead or bandwidth limit, we strongly recommend having learning resources on our platform with a size inferior as 200 Mb. We also recommend having your phone plugged in on the power for downloading.

Get in touch with your local phone provider, while using cellular network, to make sure there are not any limitation.

We also recommend using wifi connection to download learning resources.

## Note on network prerequisites

If users are connected to the corporate network, you need to ensure that this network complies with our prerequisites, in term of IP whitelisting. You can have more information in [this page](https://developers.crossknowledge.com/CKLS-prerequisites).
