## Available APIs

### REST Front Office

Our front office REST API has been originally built for our mobile applications. This API is contextualized to the learner logged during the call.

### REST back Office

Our latest API, that will replace the XMLRPC one. This API is back office, that means that it allows administrative tasks and it is not contextualized to the leaner 
as an administrator executes it.
