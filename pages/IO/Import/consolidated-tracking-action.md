### Error Messages

Message | Explanation
---- | ----
`At least one of these element must be present: learning object version code or GUID.` | A tracking row needs to be associated to a learning object, therefore a reference (lovCode or lovGuid) has to be filled in the import file.
`This learning object is provided by CrossKnowledge, and this report cannot be updated.` | Reports for CrossKnowledge learning objects cannot be modified by the import process.
`This learning object is an EasyQuizz, and this report cannot be updated.`	| Reports for Easyquizz learning objects cannot be modified by the import process.
`At least one of these element must be present: learner login, reference number or email.` | A tracking needs to be associated to a learner, therefore a learner reference (candidateLogin, candidateRefNumber or candidateEmail) has to be filled in the import file.
`At least one of the following to provide a precise context : "session GUID" or the couple "session title" & "training code".'`	| A tracking needs to be associated to a context, therefore a context reference (sessionGuid, or sessionTitle and trainingPathCode) is required.
`No registration found for given parameters.` | Given the learner and session information from the import file, the application failed to identify a registration.
`You cannot set a first completion date if the LO is not completed.` | If during an import, the tracking row is "not completed" and firstCompletionDate is specified, then the row is rejected with the message: "You cannot set a first completion date if the LO is not completed".
