## Structure of the configuration file

The XML configuration file defines the structure of the data export files

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<export-config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <export>
    	<providers>
    		<!-- Data export column and parameter definitions should be added here -->
        </providers>
        <actions>
        	<!-- Data export actions should be added here -->
        </actions>
        <consolidators>
            <moveToFolder>
                <fileName>file_name.csv</fileName>
                <folderPath>/var/www/instance/data/export/</folderPath>
            </moveToFolder> 
        </consolidators>
    </export>
</export-config>

```

## Actions

### File export action

File export action allows to create a temporary file with the data from the chosen provider.

{:.optionsTable}
Option | Description | Mandatory | Allowed values | Default value
--- | --- | --- | --- 
`format` | Format of the temporary file | No | CSV, TSV, XML, XLS | `CSV`
`encoding` | Encoding of the temporary file | No | UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, WINDOWS-1252, UTF-16LE | `UTF-8`
`delimiter` | The delimiter to be used in the temporary file to separate the columns | No | comma, pipe, semicolon, tabulation | `semicolon`
`showHeaders` | Whether or not to write the column headers to the temporary file | No | yes, no | `yes`
`decimal` | The decimal separator to be used in the temporary file | No | comma, point | `point`

For example, the following configuration will write the data given by the provider to a temporary CSV file, using UTF-8 encoding, semicolon delimiter and include column headers.

```xml
<actions>
	<fileExportAction>
		<format>CSV</format>
		<encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
		<delimiter>semicolon</delimiter>
		<showHeaders>yes</showHeaders>
	</fileExportAction>
</actions>
```

### SFTP export action

SFTP export action allows to create a temporary data file and upload it via sFTP to a remote server.

{:.optionsTable}
Option | Description | Mandatory | Allowed values | Default value
--- | --- | --- | ---
`format` | Format of the temporary file | No | CSV, TSV, XML, XLS | `CSV`
`encoding` | Encoding of the temporary file | No | UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, WINDOWS-1252, UTF-16LE | `UTF-8`
`delimiter` | The delimiter to be used in the temporary file to separate the columns | No | comma, pipe, semicolon, tabulation | `semicolon`
`showHeaders` | Whether or not to write the column headers to the temporary file | No | yes, no | `yes`
`decimal` | The decimal separator to be used in the temporary file | No | comma, point | `point`
`sftpHost` | Address of the sFTP server. | Yes | - | 
`sftpLogin` | Login to be used for the sFTP connection. | Yes | - | 
`sftpPassword` | Password to be used for the sFTP connection. |	Yes | - | 
`sftpFolder` | Path to the folder to fetch the file from. The path begins at the root folder of the supplied sFTP user. The parameter must begin with a '/'. | Yes | - |
`fileName` | Full name to be given to the file (with extension) when it is uploaded to the remote server. See Additional string formats | Yes | - | 	

The following configuration will temporarily write the data given by the provider to a temporary CSV file, encoded using UTF-8, with semicolons as delimiters, with the column headers and using a '.' as the decimal separator. The file will then be uploaded to a specific folder on `10.145.23.15` with the following name: `temp_data_{day}_{month}_{year}.csv`.

```xml
<actions>
	<sftpExportAction>
		<format>CSV</format>
		<encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
		<delimiter>semicolon</delimiter>
		<showHeaders>yes</showHeaders>
		<decimal>point</decimal>
		<sftpHost>10.145.23.15</sftpHost>
		<sftpLogin>user</sftpLogin>
		<sftpPassword>p4ssword</sftpPassword>
		<sftpFolder>/folder</sftpFolder>
		<fileName>temp_data_%d_%m_%y.csv</fileName>
	</sftpExportAction>
</actions>
```

## Consolidators

In order to work properly, the consolidators must be declared in a specific order:
1. `timeLogger`
1. `moveToFolder`
1. `emailReport`
1. `archive`
1. `generateEndFile`
1. `cleanFolder`

### Time logger

Internal processor which computes the time spent by each part of the export, to display this time spent in the scheduled task logs.


### Move to folder

Move the temporary export files to the specified folder, with a given filename format.

Option | Description | Mandatory | Default value
--- | --- | --- | ---
`fileName` | The filename format for the export files after they have been moved. | Yes | No default value
`folderPath` | Path to the folder where the files will be moved to. No base path, a full path must be given. | Yes | No default value
`deleteEmptyFiles` | If specified, empty exports files will be deleted. | No | `no`

The following consolidator will move the export files to `/var/www/instance/data/exports/`.
The export files will be renamed with respect to the following format: `export_{day}_{month}_{year}_{number of iteration}.csv`.

```xml
<consolidators>
	<moveToFolder>
		<filename>export_%d_%m_%y_%i.csv</filename>
		<folderPath>/var/www/instance/data/exports/</folderPath>
		<deleteEmptyFiles>yes</deleteEmptyFiles>
	</moveToFolder>
</consolidators>
```

Error messages

Message | Explanation
---- | ----
`The [...] parameter is missing.` | One of the mandatory parameters is empty.
`Unable to access the export temp file: [...]` | An unexpected error occured while trying to access the temporary export files. This is probably a folder/file rights problem.

`Unable to create the destination file: [...]` | An unexpected error occured while trying to create the end file. This is probably a folder/file rights problem.

### Clean folder

Similar to the CleanFolder consolidator for imports, this consolidator cleans the data in the specified folder, as well as log files (`in DATA_PATH/exports/logs`) if needed. It is possible to specify a number of days beyond which the data is considered obsolete and thus will be removed.


Option | Description | Mandatory | Default value
--- | --- | --- | ---
`dataFolderPath` | Path to the folder containing the data to be cleaned. The base path is `DATA_PATH` (the data folder of the instance). | No | No default value

`cleanOlderThan` | If specified, only clean data that is older than the number of days given in this option. | No | `30`

		<dataFolderPath>exports/data</dataFolderPath>
		<cleanLogs>yes</cleanLogs>

</consolidators>
```

Message | Explanation

`timestamp` | Whether to prepend the timestamp to the import file when moving it to the backup folder. | No | `no`


The following consolidator will move all the files from `DATA_PATH/imports/source` to `DATA_PATH/imports/destination`, prepending the timestamp to the filenames while moving them.

```xml
<postProcess>
	<moveToBackup>
		<inputFolderPath>imports/source/</inputFolderPath>
		<outputFolderPath>imports/destination/</outputFolderPath>
		<timestamp>yes</timestamp>
	</moveToBackup>
</postProcess>
