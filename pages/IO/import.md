### Borderline cases

* Blendedˣ training update

⋅⋅⋅On Blendedˣ update, if some LOs needs to be added, they are added at the end of the last step of the training. Furthermore, it's not possible to remove LOs and remove or update Steps.

⋅⋅⋅On Blendedˣ import, we create Content Milestones with some default values : Path menu title : LO title, Duration : LO duration, Max points : LO duration, Title : LO title, Subtitle : empty, CTA : "Epilang(Next)".
